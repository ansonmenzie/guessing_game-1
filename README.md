My game has five questions about my dog Finn.
The five questions are stored in an array.
A second array stores the answers to each question.
Using a for loop, the user is prompted to respond to each question.
If the response matches the answer at the same index, the answer is correct and a correct message is displayed.
If not, an incorrect message is displayed.
Added a variable to make the input upper case.
Added some semicolons.
Adjusted the else location to fit within the {}.


A few things that this does not do (yet!):
- check for answers outside available prompts (i.e. other than Y or N)
