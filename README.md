My game has five questions about my dog Finn.
The five questions are stored in an array.
A second array stores the answers to each question.
Using a for loop, the user is prompted to respond to each question.
(NEW!) if response is not one of the allowable choices; error message displayed and question is re-asked.
If the response matches the answer at the same index, the answer is correct and a correct message is displayed.
If not, an incorrect message is displayed.

Differences b/w enhance and master:
- the feature shown as (NEW!) above is in enhance
- almost every feature is stored as a function
